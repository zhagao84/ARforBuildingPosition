# ARforBuildingPosition
<!-- img src="DocGen/Images/WorldLockingSamples.svg" -->

The aim of this project is to implement an AR application so that the user can mark the space either as digging of dumping on the construction site.
And the output is a csv file which contain the 3D-coordinates of the mark points , polygons's ids which are formed by marked points, indicator for the operation(digging/dumping)

# Unity scene
The project is located within the `WorldMarkPosition/SetPosition` Unity scene.
